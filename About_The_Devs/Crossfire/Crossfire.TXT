Good day to you all. My full name is Sameel Syed Haider.
Some of my current hobbies at the time of writing are mainly gaming, Yu-Gi-Oh, and comedy.
My favourite video game is honestly hard to choose, I have different favourites for different genres and reasons. My overall favourite I'd have to say is Astroneer. It's the best game that I have ever experienced, it's very calming and relaxing and that's mainly why I like it.
